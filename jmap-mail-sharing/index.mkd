--- abstract

This document specifies an extension to the JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP) for Mail to enable sharing of mailboxes between users. Building upon the JMAP Sharing framework defined in {{RFC9670}}, this specification extends the Mailbox data type defined in {{RFC8621}} with properties necessary to configure and manage access permissions for shared mailboxes. The extension introduces a new capability that indicates server support for mailbox sharing and defines the additional properties required to share mailboxes with other principals, including the ability to control which users may access a mailbox and what permissions they possess.

# Introduction

JMAP ({{RFC8620}} — JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic protocol for synchronizing data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between a client and a server. It is optimized for mobile and web environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different data types.

{{RFC8621}} defines JMAP for Mail, which provides a data model for accessing, organizing, and managing email messages and mailboxes. The specification enables clients to efficiently synchronize mail data with servers and includes support for mailbox hierarchies, message threading, and various mail operations.

{{RFC9670}} subsequently standardized JMAP Sharing, which defines a framework for sharing data between users in collaborative environments. The specification introduces the Principal data type to represent entities (individuals, teams, or resources) and establishes a consistent model for defining shared access to data through the use of access control properties.

However, {{RFC8621}} was published prior to the standardization of the JMAP Sharing framework in {{RFC9670}}, and therefore does not incorporate the sharing model into the Mailbox data type. This creates a gap in the ability to share mailboxes using the standardized JMAP sharing mechanisms.

This document bridges that gap by defining how the Mailbox object defined in {{RFC8621}} is extended to support the sharing framework established in {{RFC9670}}. This extension enables users to share their mailboxes with other principals using a consistent sharing model that can be applied uniformly across different JMAP data types. The specification defines the necessary properties, permissions, and capability advertisements to enable interoperable mailbox sharing implementations.

## Addition to the Capabilities Object

The capabilities object is returned as part of the JMAP Session object; see {{Section 2 of RFC8620}}. This document defines one additional capability URI.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail:share

This capability indicates server support for sharing mailboxes as defined in this specification. When a server advertises this capability, it signifies that the Mailbox data type has been extended with the sharing properties defined in {{Section 4 of RFC9670}} and that clients may use these properties to configure mailbox sharing with other principals.

The value of this property in the JMAP Session "capabilities" property is an empty object.

The value of this property in an account's "accountCapabilities" property is an empty object.

# Mailbox Sharing

According to {{Section 4 of RFC9670}}, shareable data types MUST define three specific properties to participate in the JMAP sharing framework: `isSubscribed`, `myRights`, and `shareWith`. These properties enable users to control whether they wish to see shared data, understand what permissions they have, and configure who the data is shared with, respectively.

In addition to these three properties, shareable data types SHOULD define a permission within the rights object that indicates whether a user has the authority to share the object with others. This permission controls access to modifying the `shareWith` property.

The Mailbox object defined in {{Section 2 of RFC8621}} already includes the `isSubscribed` and `myRights` properties, as mailbox subscription and access control were integral features of the original mail specification. However, the specification did not include the `shareWith` property or define a permission for sharing rights.

This specification extends the JMAP Mailbox object defined in {{RFC8621}} to include the `shareWith` property as defined below:

{:vspace}
**shareWith**: `Id[MailboxRights]|null` (default: null)
: This is a map configuring who the mailbox is shared with, or null if it is not shared with anyone. Each key in the map is the id of a Principal with whom the mailbox is shared. The value for each key is the set of access rights that Principal has for the mailbox. The account id for the Principals may be found in the `urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals:owner` capability of the Account to which the mailbox belongs. The Principal to which this mailbox belongs MUST NOT be in the map. The property may only be modified if the user has the mayShare right.

This specification also extends the JMAP MailboxRights object defined in {{Section 2 of RFC8621}} to include the `mayShare` property as defined below. For servers that also support IMAP {{RFC3501}}, this property corresponds to the IMAP ACL "a" right as defined in {{RFC4314}}:

{:vspace}
**mayShare**: `Boolean`
: The user may modify the `shareWith` property for this mailbox. For servers supporting IMAP access to the same data, this corresponds to the IMAP ACL "a" right defined in {{RFC4314}}, which grants the ability to administer access control lists.

# Security Considerations

All security considerations described in {{RFC8621}} and {{RFC9670}} apply to this specification. Additional considerations specific to mailbox sharing are detailed below.

## Access Control Enforcement

Servers implementing this specification MUST strictly enforce access controls when sharing mailboxes. When a user has access to a shared mailbox, the server MUST ensure that the user can only perform operations permitted by their assigned rights. As specified in {{Section 9.5 of RFC8621}}, servers MUST treat any data the user does not have permission to access as if it did not exist. This principle extends to shared mailboxes: a user with partial access to an account MUST NOT be able to infer the existence of mailboxes or messages they do not have permission to access.

## Interaction with IMAP ACLs

Servers that provide both JMAP and IMAP {{RFC3501}} access to the same mail store should carefully consider the interaction between JMAP sharing permissions and IMAP ACLs {{RFC4314}}. The mapping between JMAP MailboxRights and IMAP ACL rights must be consistent and clearly documented. When a mailbox is shared through either interface, the permissions MUST be properly reflected in the other interface to prevent security vulnerabilities arising from inconsistent access control enforcement.

Particular attention must be paid to the `mayShare` right and IMAP ACL "a" right mapping. Servers MUST ensure that granting the `mayShare` permission through JMAP correctly corresponds to granting the "a" right in IMAP, and vice versa. Any discrepancies in permission semantics between the two protocols could lead to privilege escalation or unintended access.

## Unauthorized Sharing

As noted in {{Section 6.2 of RFC9670}}, sharing data with another user can allow an attacker who gains transitory access to an account to establish persistent access by configuring sharing with an attacker-controlled principal. Servers implementing mailbox sharing SHOULD consider requiring additional authentication or confirmation when sharing permissions are modified, particularly when adding new principals to the `shareWith` map or granting elevated permissions such as `mayShare`.

Servers MAY implement audit logging of sharing configuration changes to enable detection of unauthorized modifications. Administrators SHOULD be provided with tools to monitor and review sharing configurations across accounts.

## Information Disclosure Through Error Messages

Servers must be cautious not to leak information about the existence of mailboxes or their sharing status through error messages. When a user attempts to access or modify a mailbox they do not have permission to access, the server SHOULD return the same error response as it would if the mailbox did not exist, rather than indicating that access was denied. This prevents users from enumerating shared mailboxes they do not have access to.

Similarly, when a user attempts to share a mailbox with a principal they do not have permission to share with, error messages should not reveal whether such restrictions exist or details about the target principal.

## Resource Exhaustion

Servers SHOULD implement limits on the number of principals with whom a single mailbox may be shared to prevent resource exhaustion attacks. Servers MAY also implement rate limiting on sharing configuration changes to mitigate denial-of-service attacks through excessive modifications to sharing permissions.

As described in {{Section 6.3 of RFC9670}}, servers should be prepared to handle scenarios where users create many sharing-related state changes, which could generate numerous ShareNotification objects. Servers SHOULD implement appropriate resource limits and notification coalescing strategies.

## Privilege Escalation

Servers MUST ensure that users cannot escalate their own privileges through manipulation of sharing permissions. For example, a user who has been granted limited access to a mailbox MUST NOT be able to grant themselves additional permissions by modifying the `shareWith` property unless they have been explicitly granted the `mayShare` right.

The owner of a mailbox (the Principal associated with the account containing the mailbox) always has implicit full rights to the mailbox. This ownership MUST NOT be transferable through the sharing mechanism, and the owner MUST NOT appear in the `shareWith` map.
